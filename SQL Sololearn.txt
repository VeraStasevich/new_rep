ZOO

You manage a zoo. Each animal in the zoo comes from a different country. Here are the tables you have: Animals, Countries.
1) A new animal has come in, with the following details:
name - "Slim", type - "Giraffe", country_id - 1
Add him to the Animals table.
2) You want to make a complete list of the animals for the zooâ€™s visitors. Write a query to output a new table with each animal's name, type and country fields, sorted by countries.

INSERT into Animals 
VALUES ('Slim','Giraffe','1');

SELECT Animals.name, Animals.type, Countries.country
from animals inner join Countries on animals.country_id=countries.id
ORDER by country
